                        <p>Now that I'm actively posting on <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/taurinfox/">Fur Affinity</a>, I intend to discontinue my Yahoo Groups mailing list.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>There's a chance that I may decide to keep the mailing list around solely for the purpose of making announcements, in which case I'll restore the link to my Yahoo Groups page. But, for now, I'm not accepting new members to the list.</p>
